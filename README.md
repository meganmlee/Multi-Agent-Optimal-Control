# Multi-Robot Trajectory Optimization
Project for Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning (16-745) course at CMU. Centralized multi-robot offline planner set up as a trajectory optimization problem. Given a set of kinematic collision-free paths for each robot, the controller tries to optimize a safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible local trajectory that can be directly executed on all robots online using DIRCOL and ALTRO
