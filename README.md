# Multi-Agent-Optimal-Control

Project for Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning (16-745) course at CMU. Centralized multi-robot model predictive controller for controlling multiple robot arms in a shared workspace. Given a set of kinematic collision-free paths for each robot, the controller tries to optimize a safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible local trajectory that can be directly executed on all robots online.
